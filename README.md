# The Beatle

The metronome is a common and widely used app, but for the majority of music where there is more than just one rhythmic meter, it is inadequate! All other metronome apps require the user to manually stop and reset the metronome every time the beat changes. Ironically, these very rhythmic transitions are where it is often very important to keep track of the rhythm and pace of a song. 

Our application, Beatle, is a metronome that will let users truly customize a songâ€™s rhythm: allowing multiple meters, tempos, and accented beats to be combined and saved into one click track. Unlike other metronome apps, Beatle will make it possible to practice not just rhythm, but also **rhythm changes**! Additional features include a versatile counter that keeps track of measure numbers while the click track runs, tools that allow users to label and quickly navigate to specific parts of the song, looping that can be either integrated into the click track or temporarily applied for practice purposes, and a wide selection of sounds to choose from.
