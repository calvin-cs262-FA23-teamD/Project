Sometimes I wonder if I don’t know when to stop.
For most people, they realize their strengths and weaknesses and capitalize on the strengths while hiding the weaknesses.
They realize, for example, that their lack of coordination hinders their ability to perform competently in dance and as a result, they do not focus their efforts on dance or other coordination-driven activities.
I, on the other hand, continually put myself in positions of inadequacy, where my weaknesses are highlighted because the other people with weaknesses like me gave up a long time ago.
I keep coming back to the things I fail at, thinking that maybe this time I won’t be so bad.
Maybe it’s a symptom of dogged determination, but maybe it’s a fatal flaw.
